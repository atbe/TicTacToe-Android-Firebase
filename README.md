# Serverless Tic-Tac-Toe for Android using Firebase!

For our second CSE 476 project, myself and @joshbenner851 worked on a `Tic Tac Toe` multiplayer game!

## What we used

- `Firebase`: Firebase gave us the power of *authentication*, *data persistence*, and *real-time updates* all out of the box
- `Firebase Realtime Database`: The realtime database is where we stored all of our user and game data.

## What did we learn?

- Keeping states in multiplayer games aligned **without a server** is hard. Although the app was entirely client controlled, using a server that handled the game-logic and handling the state of the game would've dramatically reduced the code written here on the Android client.
- Firebase is sweet! It allowed us to get up and running very quickly.
- Handling lifecyles in Android is no simple task.


## Can I run this project?

Sure!

1. Just start a new Firebase project by [clicking the link here]()
